This tool lets you see the average sminspect output of an item for an accurate reading. Also functions as a numerical translator for the values.
Safe to replace your "Translator - Blacksmith" trigger with this one.

*** 1. TRIGGER ***

Name: Utility - Sminspect Average + Translator
Type: regexp
Pattern: ^(?:It is almost impossible to get a good strike with this weapon|It is difficult to use this weapon properly|It feels good when you wield this weapon--you would most likely have no trouble getting a good hit with this weapon|You should have no trouble handling this weapon--or making a cruel hit with it for that matter|Even an apprentice warrior could kill easily with this weapon|With this weapon almost every strike could be a killing blow|This weapon doesn&#39;t seem very effective|This weapon might do some damage with a lucky hit|This weapon seems quite effective|This weapon could most likely kill with a single swipe|This weapon is extremely powerful and more lethal than many of the famous weapons|With this weapon even a single warrior will be able to match a large force|This armour wouldn&#39;t even protect you from a very weak blow|This armour could perhaps reduce damage a little|This seems to be an armour of average quality|This armour would protect you very well|This is an extremely well-made armour which would protect you very well|Virtually nothing could harm you if you wore this armour).$

Usage: sma <item> - calculate the average sminspect of an item. Spammy and takes a few seconds.
If the game gets laggy after usage, clear your log.
